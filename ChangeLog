	* Makefile.am: add rsvg.
	* Makefile.include: add mono-cairo references.
	* configure.in: checks for rsvg.
	* sources/sources-2.20.xml: exclude all the private hdrs, cuts
	the API down to almost nothing.
	* rsvg/*: update to ship rsvg2-sharp.dll and associated config/pc
	files.  Breaking compat here and parallel installing from where
	we were in gnome-sharp.  The gnome-sharp API version exposes a ton 
	of junk that isn't public in the C API.

	assemblies to versioned directories.
	* gtkhtml: add 3.14 bindings with pkgconfig setup as described
	on the deploying applications page.  These are a parallel-installable
	non-gac'd replacement for the stable bindings located in gnome-sharp
	which will probably be forever frozen at API version 3.12 due to API
	incompatible changes made in 3.14.
	* gnomedesktop/Makefile.am: update to 2.20 pc files.
	* gnomedesktop/gnomedesktop-sharp-2.20.pc.in: renamed and moved to 
	non-GAC'd as above.

	* sources/sources-2.20.xml: add gtkhtml parse
